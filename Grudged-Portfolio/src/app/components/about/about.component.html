        <p class="about-description">
          I'm a senior full-stack developer who specializes in building enterprise-level applications that 
          solve real business problems. With 8+ years of experience, I've developed everything from 
          mission-critical warehouse management systems serving hundreds of users to e-commerce platforms 
          with integrated payment processing.

          My passion lies in transforming complex business requirements into clean, scalable software 
          solutions. Whether it's building real-time dashboards for manufacturing operations, creating 
          secure payment systems for online marketplaces, or developing business intelligence tools for 
          healthcare providers, I focus on delivering applications that perform reliably under pressure.

          I'm currently available for contract and freelance opportunities, specializing in Angular 
          frontends, Node.js backends, database optimization, and API development. I thrive in 
          collaborative environments and enjoy working directly with teams to turn ambitious ideas 
          into production-ready applications.

        <p class="about-description">
          When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new technologies (currently diving deeper into 
          React and advanced Node.js patterns) or working on side projects that challenge me to grow 
          as a developer.
